# <span className=highlight> What can I do with Band-e-oke?</span>

Using a laptop, tablet or a mobile device you can record yourself playing
or singing along to a backing track. These overdubs can be uploaded and then
added to later. Other people with access to the specific song page can do the
same which means you can produce a complete song together remotely.

# <span className=highlight>What equipment do I need?</span>

You will need a device with a microphone and video camera (optional) as well as
a connection to the internet. I don't recommend using your mobile data plan as
this will use a lot of data....

# <span className=highlight> How to do it?</span>

press the <span className=highlight>**PLAY**</span> button to listen to the backing track as well as any recorded
overdubs

press the <span className=highlight>**RECORD**</span> button to start recording your overdub

press <span className=highlight>**UPLOAD**</span> when you are happy with your overdub and want to save it to the
track (this means others visiting the page can see it)

press the <span className=highlight>**x**</span> in the corner of a video to delete it

the <span className=highlight>**nudge**</span> slider finely controls the start position of the overdud audio. When audio is recorded on your device there is a slight delay because of processing speed, if your recording doesn't match the backing track adjust this until they are in sync

the <span className=highlight>**gain**</span> slider adjusts the volume of your overdub

press the <span className=highlight>**SAVE**</span> button to store any changes you have made to the nudge or gain
