# What can I do with Band-e-oke?

Using a laptop, tablet or a mobile device you can record yourself playing
or singing along to a backing track. These overdubs can be uploaded and then
added to later. Other people with access to the specific song page can do the
same which means you can produce a complete song together remotely.

# What do I need?

You will need a device with a microphone and video camera (optional) as well as
a connection to the internet. I don't recommend using your mobile data plan as
this will use a lot of data....

# How to do it?

**PLAY** <-- press play to listen to the backing track as well as any recorded
overdubs

**RECORD** <-- press record to start recording your overdub

**UPLOAD** <--press upload when you are happy with your overdub and want to save it to the
track (this means others visiting the page can see it)

**x** <-- press the cross in the corner of a video to delete it
**nudge** <-- when audio is recorded on your device there is a slight delay
because of processing speed, if your recording doesn't match the backing
track adjust this until they are in sync

**gain** <-- this adjusts the volume of your overdub

**SAVE** <-- this saves any changes you have made to the nudge or gain
